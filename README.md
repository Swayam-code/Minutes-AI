## üìä Sample Response

```json
{
  "summary": "The team confirmed the product launch on June 10, assigned onboarding preparation and logistics follow-up, and discussed user feedback on mobile design.",
  "decisions": [
    "Launch set for June 10",
    "Need mobile-first dashboard for beta users"
  ],
  "actionItems": [
    {
      "task": "Prepare onboarding docs",
      "owner": "Ravi",
      "due": "June 5"
    },
    {
      "task": "Follow up with logistics team",
      "owner": "Priya",
      "due": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìÅ Sample Files

The repository includes sample meeting notes in the `samples` directory:

- `sample1.txt`: Product team meeting notes
- `sample2.txt`: Weekly team sync notes

You can use these files to test the API without creating your own meeting notes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:

### Input Validation Errors (HTTP 400)

- **Missing Text**: When no meeting notes are provided in the request body
  ```json
  { "error": "No meeting text provided" }
  ```

- **Missing File**: When no file is uploaded to the file endpoint
  ```json
  { "error": "No file uploaded" }
  ```

- **Invalid File Type**: When a non-text file is uploaded
  ```json
  { "error": "Only .txt files are allowed" }
  ```

### Server Errors (HTTP 500)

- **Gemini API Errors**: When there are issues with the Gemini API
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Failed to process meeting notes",
    "details": "Error message from Gemini API"
  }
  ```

- **JSON Parsing Errors**: When the AI response cannot be parsed as JSON
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Failed to process meeting notes",
    "details": "Failed to extract JSON from Gemini response"
  }
  ```

### File Size Limits

- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Exceeding this limit will result in a 413 Payload Too Large response

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Verify the API key is active and has sufficient quota

2. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check if port 5000 is already in use by another application
   - Verify Node.js version is compatible (v14+)

3. **Request Timeouts**
   - Large meeting notes may take longer to process
   - Consider breaking very large notes into smaller chunks

### Logs

Check the server logs for detailed error information. In development mode, all errors are logged to the console.
